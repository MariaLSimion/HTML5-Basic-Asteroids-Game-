HTML5- Javascript Application


The classic Asteroids game.
Asteroids are implemented in the form of a circle, each asteroid is associated with a randomly generated value from the range 1-4, indicating the number of missiles needed to destroy it. The number of rockets required will be permanently displayed within the drawing used for the asteroid. The color and size of the asteroid
will change according to this number. Asteroids move along linear trajectories with a determined random speed. When two asteroids collide, their trajectory changes.
The spaceship is implemented in the form of a triangle and it is controlled using the following keyboard commands: arrows (moving the ship up / down / left / right at a constant speed), z – turn to the left, c – turn to the right, x – launch a missile in the direction in which the ship is oriented; the ship can
move in all four directions regardless of current orientation.
